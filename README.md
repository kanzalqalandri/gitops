# Requirements

1) Should be easy to understand so developers can follow and implement it themselves. A DevOps engineer should only be involved when absolutely necessary.
2) Must be easily replicable across multiple clusters/clients.
3) Should provide flexibility without requiring overly complex templating.
4) We donâ€™t need Helm charts in this repo if we can easily point to official repository.

1) Cookiecutter
